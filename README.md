##About 
A personal landing site, complete with bio and resume and written in bare-bones HTML5 and CSS for my comp20 class. 
Everything required has been correctly implemented as required. A CNAME note has been added to redirect my *.github.io site to my personal domain.

##Discussion and attribution
No discussion have been made with anyone in the class, nor outside. The profile picture has been obtained from Google, but no clear attribution has been found. The redirect script is found from stackoverflow. 
##Time spent
About 1-2 hours plus minus, mostly spent on figuring out the styling as I'm a terrible frontender. ;)
